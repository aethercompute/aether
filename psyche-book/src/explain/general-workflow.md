# General Workflow

## Client

A client is an active participant responsible for executing the training tasks within a run. It handles assigned data batches for training, generates commitments, and participates in the witness process when elected to validate the work of its peers. Each client maintains its own state synchronized with the Coordinator.

## Coordinator

The Coordinator stores metadata about the training run's state and a list of participants.

It handles the transition between each Phase of a Round, and provides a random seed that's used to determine data assignments, witnesses, and more.

It's responsible for providing a point of synchronization for all clients within a run.

## Ticks (State Transitions)

The coordinator behaves like a state machine, moving from one state to another, with each state transition having specific requirements.

When certain events occur or time-based conditions are met, the Coordinator can be "ticked" forwards to transition from one Phase to another Phase.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    loop
        Note over Backend, Coordinator: Wait for a timeout or backend state
        Backend->>Coordinator: Tick
        Coordinator->>Backend: New state produced
        Backend->Client1: New coordinator state consumed by Client
        Backend->Client2: New coordinator state consumed by Client
    end
```

In this case the backend is just the layer of the Clients that communicates with the Coordinator, depending on the run nature it will communicate with Solana blockchain or just via TCP to the coordinator.

### Beginning an Epoch (state: WaitingForMembers)

The Coordinator begins in the `WaitingForMembers` phase, with no clients connected.

Whatever backend you're running the Coordinator in should accept pending clients to be added to upcoming Epochs.

When inside the `WaitingForMembers` phase, your backend will pass new clients to the Coordinator until a configured `min_clients` threshold is met, at which point the coordinator's `tick` will transition it to the `Warmup` phase.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Note over Coordinator: min_clients = 2
    Client1->>Coordinator: Join
    Client2->>Coordinator: Join
    Note over Coordinator: Entering Warmup
    Client1->>Client2: Connect
    Client2->>Client1: Connect
```

### Model Loading (state: Warmup)

This phase is designed to let all clients download the model & load it onto their GPUs.

If a client has dropped whilst waiting for the warmup time to elapse, the Backend then removes the client from the Coordinator's clients list and in case the number of clients falls below `min_clients`, the Coordinator goes back to the `WaitingForMembers` phase and wait for more clients to join.

There's two different ways the coordinator will transition to the `RoundTrain` phase:

- If all the participant clients have finished loading the model and are ready to start training they send a specific message to the Coordinator and if the Coordinator receives this message from all clients, it transitions to the `RoundTrain` phase earlier.
- If the `Warmup` max time passes the Coordinator will transition to the `RoundTrain` phase even if not all clients have finished loading the model. This max time is configurable and can be set in the configuration file.

The Backend will watch for the state transition and all clients will be notified of this new `Training` Coordinator state.

### Training (state: RoundTrain)

In this phase, the Coordinator provides a random seed, each client can use this seed, alongside the current round index and epoch index to determine which indices of the whole training batch they will train on. Basically every client will train on a different subset of the training data.

As clients complete their training, they send their results to all other clients, including the Witnesses. The witnesses will each send a **witness proof** to the Coordinator, building towards a **witness quorum**.

A witness proof contains a bloom filter describing which pieces of data the witness received training results for, and which clients did that work. Elected witnesses are responsible for creating these witness proofs and and sending them to the Coordinator.

The witnesses for each round are chosen randomly from all the clients, using the same random seed as for data assignments. A witness will attempt to send an **opportunistic witness** message once it's seen a received a training result for every single batch in the current round. That message lets the Coordinator know that it can transition to the _Witness_ phase without waiting all the training time.

The Coordinator advances the run from the _Training_ phase to the _Witness_ phase in one of two ways:

- If enough witnesses observe all results and reach a **witness quorum** for the round, they notify the Coordinator that it is safe to advance. This process, named **opportunistic witnessing**, accelerates the transition to the _Witness_ phase, rather than having to wait a fixed time for training results.
- If witnesses do not receive all required results from other clients before the maximum time specified for the _Training_ phase, the Coordinator will nonetheless transition to the _Witness_ phase after the maximum _Training_ time elapses.

The Backend will watch for the state transition and all clients will be notified of this new `Witness` Coordinator state.

### Witness phase (state: RoundWitness)

This phase exists to give the witnesses an opportunity to send their proofs to the Coordinator in the event that they have not received enough training results from other clients to have reached the quorum and send their proofs opportunistically.

There is also brief slack period for non-witness nodes to catch up by downloading any remaining results they might have not received.

When the _Witness_ phase finishes only reaching the maximum witness time, the Coordinator transitions from _Witness_ to the _Training_ phase again in most of the cases, it only transitions to a new state known as _Cooldown_ in the following three cases:

- If we are in the last round of the epoch.
- If the clients have dropped to less than the minimum required by the config.
- If the number of witnesses for the round is less than the quorum specified by the config.

Any clients that have failed [health checks](#health-checks) will also be removed from the current epoch.

### Cooldown phase (state: Cooldown)

The _Cooldown_ phase is the last phase of an epoch, during which the Coordinator waits the _Cooldown_ period to elapse. At this point the clients will begin to do a new checkpoint of the model, this is saving the state of the model at that time to a external storage, such as a Hugging Face.

When the _Cooldown_ phase begins, the Coordinator also resets the current model checkpoint state to `Checkpoint::P2P`, indicating that new joiners should download the latest copy of the model from the other participants and not from the usual checkpoint.

Upon exiting the _Cooldown_ phase, the Coordinator transitions to the next epoch, saving the previous epoch state, and moving back to the _WaitingForMembers_ phase. All the clients that were participating in the previous epoch automatically join to the new epoch unless they exit manually.

### It all comes together

Here's is an overview of how the state of the run can change depending on the situation:

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': { 'fontSize':'35px'}}}%%
flowchart LR
    WFM((Waiting For Members))
    W((Warmup))
    T((Training))
    WI((Witness))
    CD((Cooldown))
    a{Are enough clients to start}
    b{All clients loaded the model}
    c{Max warmup time passed}
    d{Witness quorum reached}
    e{Max training time passed}
    f{End of the epoch reached}

    WFM --> a
    a -->|Yes| W
    a -->|No| WFM
    b -->|Yes| T
    b -->|No| c
    W --> b
    c -->|Yes| T
    c -->|No| W
    T --> d
    d -->|Yes| WI
    d -->|No| e
    e -->|Yes| WI
    WI --> f
    f -->|Yes| CD
    f -->|No| T
    CD --> WFM
```

And this is how it fits with real the real clients and how they interact in each of the stages. The committee in this case is the structure that contains all the witness data for the round.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Backend->>Coordinator: tick
    Coordinator->>Backend: Change state to `RoundTrain`

    Backend->>Client2: New state

        Client2->>Client2: Start training
    end
    Client1->>Committee: get_witness
    Client2->>Committee: get_witness
    Committee->>Client1: false
    Committee->>Client2: true
    Note over Client1: Train
    Note over Client2: Train
    Note over Client2: Fill bloom filters
    Client2->>Backend: send opportunistic witness
    Backend->>Coordinator: Witness message
    Note over Coordinator: Enough witnesses for round
    Coordinator->>Coordinator: Update state to RoundWitness
    Note over Coordinator: Timeout round witness time
    alt step > total steps
        Coordinator->>Coordinator: Update state to Finished
    else current_epoch_time == max_time_per_epoch
        Coordinator->>Coordinator: Update state to Cooldown
    else
        Coordinator->>Coordinator: Update state to RoundTrain with step + 1
    end
```

## Health checks

Each client should repeatedly send health checks to the coordinator. Clients are assigned a score determined by the Coordinator using the `trainer_healthy_score_by_witnesses` method. This score increases as a client sends the required data to be added to the participants' bloom filters, allowing the Coordinator to confirm that the client is actively participating in the training.

A client also sends a list of other clients it considers unhealthy to the server using the `HealthCheck` message. The Coordinator processes this information to determine whether those clients are healthy. Clients deemed inactive or non-participatory are marked for removal in the next round.

## Centralized Backend

In this Backend, the Coordinator is owned and ticked forwards by a Server that communicates via clients over TCP.

The Server's Coordinator is initially configured in the main file of the server.
It's loaded using the configuration a specific configuration file `state.toml`

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    S[Server] --run--> A[App]
    S --new--> C[Coordinator]
    C --Run config--> A
```

The Server uses some parts of the Coordinator configuration, like the data server configuration, if enabled, to boot up all the functionality it needs.

When a new client joins the run it has to communicate the `run_id` that it wants to join, to ensure the client's joining the correct run. After processing the join message, the client is added to a pending clients list, and runs the Coordinator's tick function to potentially add the client into the run.

When a tick condition is met, the Server ticks the Coordinator forwards, then broadcasts the Coordinator's new state to all connected clients.

## Decentralized Backend

In this Backend, the Coordinator is an account associated with a Solana Program, and ticked forwards by a `tick` method that can be called by anyone.

A training run can be created by calling the `init_coordinator` method in the Coordinator program, and subsequently information about the model to be trained can be set by calling the `update` method.

For a new client to join the run, it must call the `join_run` method in the Coordinator program and pass the `run_id` for the run it intends to join. After the Solan Program processes the join message, the client is added to a pending clients list, and the Program runs the Coordinator's tick function to potentially add the client into the run.

When a tick condition is met, anybody using Solana can tick the Coordinator forwards by calling the `tick` method (clients in a Run will do this automatically). This new state is then read via an RPC subscription on each Client, progressing through the regular state machine.
